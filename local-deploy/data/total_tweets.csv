113                             i would define in brief the poetry of words as the rhythmical creation of beauty   
117                                 man is a creature who lives not upon bread alone but primarily by catchwords   
128                                                                                    change before you have to   
135                                                       if the world seems cold to you kindle fires to warm it   
139                                                     the less we deserve good fortune the more we hope for it   
142                                     humanity is acquiring all the right technology for all the wrong reasons   
145                 another belief of mine that everyone else my age is an adult whereas i am merely in disguise   
147                                                          the most wasted of all days is one without laughter   
148      a life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable but more useful than a life spent doing nothing   
154                                                              god cannot alter the past though historians can   
159                                                                             hindsight is always twentytwenty   
165                                                                   begin to be now what you will be hereafter   
172                                         the thermometer of success is merely the jealousy of the malcontents   
176                                                                                   when one teaches two learn   
180                                                                         i want to live my life not record it   
191                                                   theres no use doing a kindness if you do it a day too late   
194                                    cherish your human connections your relationships with friends and family   
197                                                                          we pass through this world but once   
204                                          there is nothing which we receive with so much reluctance as advice   
211                                                          we are not makers of history we are made by history   
213                                                                       failure is success if we learn from it   
217                                                                it is not how old you are but how you are old   
220                                                                                      peace is its own reward   
225                                                                                 dreams are necessary to life   
230                                      man is so made that when anything fires his soul impossibilities vanish   
233                                                                            love the giver more than the gift   
238                                                                                 i didnt think i experimented   
241                                                                        they can conquer who believe they can   
245                                                           everything has been figured out except how to live   
249                                                           prosperity tries the fortunate adversity the great   
250                                                    what is called genius is the abundance of life and health   
252                                                                           at times i think and at times i am   
254                                                                                          to live is to think   
259                                                                                       plodding wins the race   
262                                          the man who is swimming against the stream knows the strength of it   
267                                                            the more things change the more they are the same   
273                                                         if you cant feed a hundred people then feed just one   
278                                                        the boisterous sea of liberty is never without a wave   
281                                                    never retreat never explain get it done and let them howl   
283                                                           experience is simply the name we give our mistakes   
285                                                                    happiness is good health and a bad memory   
286                                        worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow it only saps today of its joy   
288                                                                          sweet mercy is nobilitys true badge   
290                                     he has achieved success who has worked well laughed often and loved much   
297                                                        it would not be possible to praises nurses too highly   
300                                it is an ironic habit of human beings to run faster when we have lost our way   
311                                               its easy to make a buck its a lot tougher to make a difference   
315    as america celebrates memorial day we pay tribute to those who have given their lives in our nations wars   
318           the most satisfying thing in life is to have been able to give a large part of ones self to others   
320  every man has his own destiny the only imperative is to follow it to accept it no matter where it leads him   
324                          life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs   
326         a person will sometimes devote all his life to the development of one part of his body  the wishbone   
333                                                                there is just one life for each of us our own   
338                                                                               work is much more fun than fun

5    every man has his own destiny the only imperative is to follow it to accept it no matter where it leads him   
16                           life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs   
28                                                          what then is freedom the power to live as one wishes   
33     my father always used to say that when you die if youve got five real friends then youve had a great life   
60                        men can starve from a lack of selfrealization as much as they can from a lack of bread   
66                                                         if you count all your assets you always show a profit   
83                                                     between saying and doing many a pair of shoes is worn out   
122                                                                                you exist only in what you do   
133                                                                     to be free is to have achieved your life   
164                                                                change is the end result of all true learning   
177                                                  we shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do   
186                                                            forgive many things in others nothing in yourself   
195                                                                          one faces the future with ones past   
284                  there is a single light of science and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere

292                   the present time has one advantage over every other  it is our own   
293                                          i imagine that yes is the only living thing   
294                          people seldom refuse help if one offers it in the right way   
295                                                      fear is the mother of foresight   
296                            when i pray coincidences happen and when i dont they dont   
298                              a friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature   
299                                    if you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen   
301                                                    necessity dispenseth with decorum   
304                                      it is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves   
305  words are often seen hunting for an idea but ideas are never seen hunting for words   
307                                                  all great achievements require time   
308                                  nothing makes one feel so strong as a call for help   
313                                           courage is fear holding on a minute longer   
325                                the backbone of surprise is fusing speed with secrecy   
327              a true friend never gets in your way unless you happen to be going down   
330                                                    man  a being in search of meaning

9        many of lifes failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up   
22                                                  to read without reflecting is like eating without digesting   
31                                                 people are trapped in history and history is trapped in them   
34                                                          we all have ability the difference is how we use it   
37                                                                            the pen is the tongue of the mind   
43                 blessed is the man who having nothing to say abstains from giving wordy evidence of the fact   
47                                                     to different minds the same world is a hell and a heaven   
50           the more sand that has escaped from the hourglass of our life the clearer we should see through it   
51                there are many men of principle in both parties in america but there is no party of principle   
56   everyone is a genius at least once a year the real geniuses simply have their bright ideas closer together   
62                           for the happiest life days should be rigorously planned nights left open to chance   
70                                                     walk while ye have the light lest darkness come upon you   
98                                                   sooner or later those who win are those who think they can   
166                                      good friends good books and a sleepy conscience this is the ideal life   
199                                                      i think in terms of the days resolutions not the years   
209                                            millions saw the apple fall but newton was the one who asked why   
226                                                                                         i am still learning   
235                                                                                its always too early to quit   
246                                          the more refined and subtle our minds the more vulnerable they are   
251                                                                       a good laugh is sunshine in the house   
257                         think where mans glory most begins and ends and say my glory was i had such friends   
263                                                          there is nothing like a dream to create the future   
271                                  all the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on   
275                                                                                         life is but thought   
277                                                     we are no longer happy so soon as we wish to be happier   
316                                                                  glory is fleeting but obscurity is forever   
317                                                               hope is independent of the apparatus of logic   
323                                             a man should always consider how much he has more than he wants

340                                           our knowledge is a little island in a great ocean of nonknowledge   
346                                                  when one burns ones bridges what a very nice fire it makes

334                                          life is a long lesson in humility   
335                 nothing is work unless youd rather be doing something else   
341                                           doubt is the father of invention   
343  the very essence of instinct is that its followed independently of reason   
344      freedom means the opportunity to be what we never thought we would be   
345             the return we reap from generous actions is not always evident   
347  imagination and fiction make up more than three quarters of our real life   
348                                          the pen is the tongue of the mind   
349                               we have i fear confused power with greatness

42                                                                      patience is the companion of wisdom   
45                                        metaphors have a way of holding the most truth in the least space   
52                                                                  hope is but the dream of those who wake   
58                                                    the art of living is more like wrestling than dancing   
65                                                                       knowledge comes but wisdom lingers   
67           there is nothing more likely to start disagreement among people or countries than an agreement   
71                                                                   the greatest remedy for anger is delay   
85                                                                      the end of labor is to gain leisure   
87      the aim of life is to live and to live means to be aware joyously drunkenly serenely divinely aware   
94                                                                    big words seldom accompany good deeds   
102                                              sooner or later those who win are those who think they can   
105                                                                                          to begin begin

120                                           i have noticed that nothing i never said ever did me any harm   
127                                                     the finest steel has to go through the hottest fire   
131                                                                           with renunciation life begins   
134                                                          when all else is lost the future still remains   
137               all wish to possess knowledge but few comparatively speaking are willing to pay the price   
141                                      everything in the world may be endured except continual prosperity   
151                                                            freedom is nothing but a chance to be better   
170                                                                     who covets more is evermore a slave   
178                                                                              the first wealth is health   
179                           the most worthwhile thing is to try to put happiness into the lives of others   
185           it is the set of the sails not the direction of the wind that determines which way we will go   
190                                                                                dream in a pragmatic way   
201  we must be willing to let go of the life we have planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us   
214                                                                                 and thats the way it is   
218                     without wearing any mask we are conscious of we have a special face for each friend   
222                                             we must make the best of those ills which cannot be avoided   
228                                                                        words are but the signs of ideas   
231                      just as a candle cannot burn without fire men cannot live without a spiritual life   
232            the only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible   
236                        little minds are tamed and subdued by misfortune but great minds rise above them   
239                                                                       ideas shape the course of history   
242                                                               you can never plan the future by the past   
248                                           the art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe   
261                                                                        in fair weather prepare for foul   
265                                              the best way to keep your friends is not to give them away   
268                                              words are of course the most powerful drug used by mankind   
270                                   this is the most joyful day that ever i saw in my pilgrimage on earth   
272                                                             the most effective way to do it is to do it   
274              how little do they see what really is who frame their hasty judgment upon that which seems

81           if fear is cultivated it will become stronger if faith is cultivated it will achieve mastery   
99                                                  if moderation is a fault then indifference is a crime   
101                                                                                        to begin begin   
108                             the essential conditions of everything you do must be choice love passion   
114                                               the hardest thing is to take less when you can get more   
121                                              our deeds determine us as much as we determine our deeds   
124                     i have come to believe that this is a mighty continent which was hitherto unknown   
130                                               the absence of alternatives clears the mind marvelously   
132                                                            theyre only truly great who are truly good   
136            of all human activities mans listening to god is the supreme act of his reasoning and will   
138                                                              he that lives upon hope will die fasting   
146                                                             silent gratitude isnt very much to anyone   
155                     we relish news of our heroes forgetting that we are extraordinary to somebody too   
158                                              the best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up   
162                                               start with what is right rather than what is acceptable   
169            laughter is the sensation of feeling good all over and showing it principally in one place   
174                                         those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it   
189                             no one has a greater asset for his business than a mans pride in his work   
193                                    i will honor christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year   
202                                                                            if youth knew if age could   
203                   the art of being happy lies in the power of extracting happiness from common things   
205                                                      believe and act as if it were impossible to fail   
208                                                           we cannot put off living until we are ready   
215                                          its better to be a lion for a day than a sheep all your life   
221  a man who gives his children habits of industry provides for them better than by giving them fortune   
237                               there are many ways of going forward but only one way of standing still   
256                                                            the secret of happiness is something to do   
264                                                                        silence is the mother of truth   
280                             the past is really almost as much a work of the imagination as the future   
289                     they always say time changes things but you actually have to change them yourself   
291                                                                     perfection itself is imperfection   
309                                                      i hear i know i see i remember i do i understand   
310                                                             we are all gifted that is our inheritance

118         personally im always ready to learn although i do not always like being taught   
125              to give without any reward or any notice has a special quality of its own   
140                          theres a difference between a philosophy and a bumper sticker   
143                                                                 i think therefore i am   
144                                                       neither blame or praise yourself   
149    the only courage that matters is the kind that gets you from one moment to the next   
150                                      you always admire what you really dont understand   
152                           voters dont decide issues they decide who will decide issues   
153                      true originality consists not in a new manner but in a new vision   
157           faith is the strength by which a shattered world shall emerge into the light   
160                                    the undertaking of a new action brings new strength   
161                               if you do not conquer self you will be conquered by self   
167  there is one day that is ours thanksgiving day is the one day that is purely american   
168   feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it   
173                                                      a good beginning makes a good end   
182                                                       home is the nicest word there is   
183       theres a world of difference between truth and facts facts can obscure the truth   
192                            maybe christmas the grinch thought doesnt come from a store   
196                                           the less you talk the more youre listened to   
198                            every man regards his own life as the new years eve of time   
200                                                   the sweetest of all sounds is praise   
206          the person who can bring the spirit of laughter into a room is indeed blessed

0                                          to affect the quality of the day that is the highest of arts   
11                                    our knowledge is a little island in a great ocean of nonknowledge   
13       becoming a dad means you have to be a role model for your son and be someone he can look up to   
20                                           nothing is work unless youd rather be doing something else   
25                                                                       work is much more fun than fun   
30                                       the return we reap from generous actions is not always evident   
36                                                     talent does what it can genius does what it must   
40    hold yourself responsible for a higher standard than anybody expects of you never excuse yourself   
46                                           laziness may appear attractive but work gives satisfaction   
57                                              i have no methods all i do is accept people as they are   
64                                           honor is not the exclusive property of any political party   
69                                       life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about   
74                                   a great work is made out of a combination of obedience and liberty   
78         a great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep   
84                                                                         leap and the net will appear   
88                          i just invent then wait until man comes around to needing what ive invented   
93        living in dreams of yesterday we find ourselves still dreaming of impossible future conquests   
96                        more business is lost every year through neglect than through any other cause   
103                                               if moderation is a fault then indifference is a crime   
110                                                                 life is an adventure in forgiveness   
156                                                              it is better to rust out than wear out   
163                                          laughter is the sun that drives winter from the human face   
171                         the great advantage about telling the truth is that nobody ever believes it   
175                                                                 courage is found in unlikely places   
181                                      some things are so unexpected that no one is prepared for them   
187                                                 few men have virtue to withstand the highest bidder   
210                                                                           anger cannot be dishonest   
212        a certain amount of opposition is a great help to a man kites rise against not with the wind   
216                                                                                  dont think just do   
219                               our entire life  consists ultimately in accepting ourselves as we are   
227                                             curiosity will conquer fear even more than bravery will   
229                                                    be faithful to that which exists within yourself   
234                                                                friendship is love without his wings   
240                           the world of reality has its limits the world of imagination is boundless   
244  the whole secret of life is to be interested in one thing profoundly and in a thousand things well   
247                                                                              when you doubt abstain   
255                                                                          every burden is a blessing   
258                                                    peace and justice are two sides of the same coin   
260                                                                       to hold a pen is to be at war   
266                     everything that is beautiful and noble is the product of reason and calculation   
276                                     the most wasted day of all is that on which we have not laughed   
279                                                              a pure hand needs no glove to cover it   
282                       the mystery of government is not how washington works but how to make it stop   
287                                  it is better to know some of the questions than all of the answers   
312                                                                             either move or be moved   
314                                                        the soul is the voice of the bodys interests   
319                                                              words are but pictures of our thoughts   
321                                                       that which does not kill us makes us stronger   
322                     you cant expect to hit the jackpot if you dont put a few nickels in the machine   
328                                                                each day is the scholar of yesterday   
331                                                         our happiness depends on wisdom all the way   
332                                                     one father is more than a hundred schoolmasters   
336                                  success is getting what you want happiness is wanting what you get   
339      life ought to be a struggle of desire toward adventures whose nobility will fertilize the soul

1                                                             a man is what he thinks about all day long   
10        life ought to be a struggle of desire toward adventures whose nobility will fertilize the soul   
14                                                          it is a wise father that knows his own child   
21                                                   genius aint anything more than elegant common sense   
48   this is the precept by which i have lived prepare for the worst expect the best and take what comes   
54                                                                    all wealth is the product of labor   
61                         dreams will get you nowhere a good kick in the pants will take you a long way   
68                                                                            to advise is not to compel   
72                                                                      never find fault with the absent   
76                                                                     solitude vivifies isolation kills   
82                                                     only the wisest and stupidest of men never change   
86                                     what happens is not as important as how you react to what happens   
90                                obstacles are things a person sees when he takes his eyes off his goal   
91                                                                      one fails forward toward success   
97        if you are lucky enough to find a way of life you love you have to find the courage to live it   
104                                                           i am a part of everything that i have read   
112                                   the young man knows the rules but the old man knows the exceptions   
115                                                   life without liberty is like a body without spirit

2                                  if you want a thing done well do it yourself

49                                        you will never win if you never begin   
53    imagination and fiction make up more than three quarters of our real life   
63  much that passes as idealism is disguised hatred or disguised love of power   
73                                 ambition is but avarice on stilts and masked   
77    idealism increases in direct proportion to ones distance from the problem   
79     let us be grateful to the mirror for revealing to us our appearance only

92   one cannot and must not try to erase the past merely because it does not fit the present

129                            the actions of men are the best interpreters of their thoughts   
184                    the whole point of getting things done is knowing what to leave undone   
207                               our character is what we do when we think no one is looking   
223                                                        every failure is a step to success

253                                courage is the ladder on which all the other virtues mount   
269                             tact is the ability to describe others as they see themselves
